# Angular2-Intro
This repo contains a demo project used for a presentation introducing angular 2 & typescript. It is set up to run with Spring Boot. For the moment the Spring Boot only serves the angular 2 application, but soon it will also be used as a rest service controller.

For now, we want to focus on building angular 2 applications and try to keep the build & module loading process as simple as possible.

The main project consists of two sub projects
- frontend: contains the Angular 2 code   
- backend:  a Maven project that contains the Spring Boot application

In order to run the application you will first need to set up the frontend project. In order to do so, you first have to follow these steps.

- Install node.js  
- Install typescript globally: npm install typescript -g. You can run the typescript compiler with tsc from now on.
- Install gulp globally: npm install gulp -g. 

After that you need to go to the frontend project where you will find 3 configuration files: gulp.json, package.json,, tsconfig.json.
